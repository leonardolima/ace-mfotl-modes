## Ace MFOTL Modes
This project specifies modes and syntax highlight rules for formulas, signatures and traces in the context of Metric First-Order Temporal Logic (MFOTL) monitoring.

The modes `mode-mfotl_formula`,  `mode-mfotl_signature` and `mode-mfotl_trace` are specified for the [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) code editor.

## Usage
Simply use [Ace MFOTL](https://github.com/leonardolima/ace-mfotl), a fork of [Ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace) that includes these modes.

Alternatively, you can copy the `*.js` files to the `../ace/src/mode` folder in your local machine with the script `copy_modes`. From the root folder, run
`$ ./copy_modes.sh`
